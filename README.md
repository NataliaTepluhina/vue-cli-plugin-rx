# vue-cli-plugin-rx

Vue CLI 3 plugin for adding RxJS support to project using vue-rx.

## How to Use

You need Vue CLI 3 installed globally as a pre-requisite. If you don't have it, please run

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

To add RxJS support to your vue-cli-powered project, run the following command in the project root folder:

```
vue add rx
```

You will be prompted to choose if you want to use a demo component. If you pick `yes` option, the component will be created in `components` folder. It's a simple RxJS-powered click counter.
